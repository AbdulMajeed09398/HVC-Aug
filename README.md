# HVC-Aug
This repository encloses some general functions implementation used in the Efficient Data Augmentation for Machine Learning Classifiers Using Horizontal and Vertical Contractions

**Dataset used in Experimentation**

Three real-world datasets have been used to evaluate the effectivenss of the proposed HVC-Aug.

**1- Adult **
This is the reasonable size dataset encompassing the diverse information of individuals. It has been widely used by database and privacy community for experimentation purposes.

**2- Stroke Prediction Dataset**
This data set has been widely used in machine learning, particularly, imbalanced learning problem. This dataset has been widely used in many AI competition due to higher imbalance.

**3- Census Income**
This is the largest dataset encompassing the diverse information of individuals. It has been widely used by database and privacy community for experimentation purposes.
