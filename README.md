# HVC-Aug
This repository encloses some general functions implementation used in the Efficient Data Augmentation for Machine Learning Classifiers Using Horizontal and Vertical Contractions

**Dataset used in Experimentation**

Three real-world datasets have been used to evaluate the effectivenss of the proposed HVC-Aug.

**1-Adult**

This is the reasonable size dataset encompassing the diverse information of US individuals. It has been widely used by database and privacy community for experimentation purposes. Further details about this dataset can be learned from  https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214234

**2- Stroke Prediction Dataset**

This data set has been widely used in machine learning, particularly, imbalanced learning problem. This dataset has been widely used in many AI competition due to higher imbalance. Further details about this dataset can be learned from  https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214234

**3- Census Income**

This is the largest dataset encompassing the diverse information of individuals. It has been widely used by database and privacy community for experimentation purposes. Further details about this dataset can be learned from https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10197160
